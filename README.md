**README.md**

## Project Overview

This project provides tools to automate the Git commit process, combining custom scripts with AI-powered commit message generation features.

**Key Files**

* **setup_commit_helper.sh:** A Bash setup script that installs dependencies, establishes aliases, and prompts for an API key.
* **automate_git_commit.py:** A Python script responsible for the core automation process, including handling file changes and pushing commits.
* **autoGitCommit.py:** A Python script containing the AI-powered commit message generation logic.

**Prerequisites**

1. Python 3
2. A Google Cloud Platform project with access to the Generative Language API.
3. A valid API key for the Generative Language API.

**Setup**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup_commit_helper.sh
   ```
   You will be prompted to provide your Google Cloud API key.

**Usage**

1. Make changes to your project files.
2. The `automate_git_commit.py` script will run in the background, periodically checking for changes.
3. When changes are detected, it will:
   * Generate a commit message prompt based on the changes.
   * Use the `autoGitCommit.py` script to refine this prompt with AI assistance.
   * Optionally ask for your confirmation.
   * Commit and push the changes to your remote Git repository.

**Customization**

* Modify the scripts to tailor the commit messages to your preferences.
* Change the loop delay in `automate_git_commit.py` to adjust the frequency of Git checks.
* Explore the Generative Language API for further customization of the AI-powered message generation.

**Important Notes**

* Ensure you have set your `API_KEY` environment variable correctly before running.
* It's recommended that you review the automatically generated commit messages before they are pushed.

**Example Workflow**

1. Edit a file in your repository.
2. Stage the changes with `git add`.
3. The `automate_git_commit.py` script will detect the change and generate a commit message.
4. If desired, you'll be asked to confirm the message.
5. The changes are committed and pushed to your remote.
